# TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING ENSEMBLE APPROACH
In this project, I applied 6 different time series forecasting models to the daily bike-sharing dataset and adopted the average of the forecasts from the different models as the actual forecast. The 5 theoretical models used are Winter-Holt, Tbats, TF Probability, SARIMAX, Facebook Prophet, Facebook Prophet plus XGBoost. The dataset has holidays taken into consideration as well as external regressors, hence forecasting into the future will require prior knowledge of fixing the external regressors. Technologies used in this project are:
 - Pandas
 - Numpy
 - statsmodel
 - tbats
 - tensorflow_probability
 - pmdarima
 - fbprophet
 - xgboost
