# TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING ENSEMBLE APPROACH
In this project, I applied 6 different time series forecasting model to daily bike sharing dataset and adopted the average of the forecasts from the different model as the actual forcast. The 5 theoretical model used are Winter-Holt, Tbats, TF Probability, SARIMAX, Facebook Prophet, Facebook Prophet plus XGBoost. The dataset has holidays taken into consideration as well as external regressor, hence forcasting into the future will request prior knowldge of fixing of the external regressors. Technologies used in this project are:
 - Pnadas
 - Numpy
 - statsmodel
 - tbats
 - tensorflow_probability
 - pmdarima
 - fbprophet
 - xgboost
